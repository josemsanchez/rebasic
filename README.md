# GIT MICROMATERIAL FOR REBASING

Rebasing is scary for people. We need to practice it to feel 
less scared. Practicing with immediate actionable feedback 
could help this process. Here's me trying to do that with 
node.

## Task - switch to a feature branch and fixup two commits 

If you're ready to start, switch to the `clean_up` branch using:

`git checkout clean_up`

and read the README to find out what to do.
